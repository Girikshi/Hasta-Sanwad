Abstractâ€”Sign language is a natural language that uses different means of expression like visual gestures or signs for communication in everyday life. As compared to other sign languages Indian Sign Language interpretation has got less attention from researchers. Especially for Devanagari sign language interpretation there are very few tools available. Our android application deals with images of bare hands, which allows the user to interact with the system in a natural way. System provides opportunities for deaf people to communicate with other people without the need of an interpreter. Other people can also use it to learn sign language. We are going to build a system for the automatic recognition of Devanagari sign language. Input of our system will be an image and output of it will be it&amp;#39;s Marathi interpretation for the given image. We will use deep learning algorithms to train our network and to draw results from it. Thus, we are implementing a user - friendly system for conversion of sign language into Marathi.
